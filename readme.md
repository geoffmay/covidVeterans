## Proposal to Standandardize Fully Automated Real-time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)

* The COVID-19 pandemic is real bad.
  * It has a “sweet spot” case fatality rate.
    * In the elderly and immocompromised, it overwhelms the alveoli in the lungs.
    * Patients who can fight it simply get a cough and fever, which leads them to spread it like a normal community-acquired infection.
  * It spreads very easily
    * through aerosols produced by coughing or sneezing
    * it lives outside of a host for several days
  * Measures to contain it have rocked the economy.
    * Social distancing has caused schools, restaurants, and gatherings to be closed.
    * Attempts at economic stimulus are thought to be futile without addressing the root of the problem, i.e. the virus itself.
  * There is a high probability of more outbreaks like this in the future.
    * Infections are thought to come from animal reservoirs.

* The best way to contain an epidemic requires the ability to identify cases rapidly.
  * You test an infected person’s contacts, and their contacts, and quarantine anyone who tests positive.
  * The most sensitive test is polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The most useful of these is a “realtime” PCR.
    * It’s complicated to perform and is easy to mess up.
    * Automated systems for realtime PCR have been proposed, but no commercial packages exist. 
        * (the final step of amplification is largely automated, but the prior steps are not)
    * There is little profit motive for hospitals to buy machines that can perform tests at high capacity, because they would spend most of their time sitting idle.
  * Therefore, manufacturers have not come forward with solutions that are simple to use and can perform realtime PCR at scale.


* To better address future outbreaks, I propose a worldwide standard be adopted for machines that can perform real time PCR with minmal training. 
    * These machines must be capable of processing a large number of samples in a short time period.
    * They should be operable with a low level of training.
    * Essentially, just insert the swab(s) and push the button.
    * They should produce results that are easy to interpret.
    * They should include a maintenance plan that includes easy replacement of reagents.
    * They should be adaptable enough to allow for rapid addition of tests for new nucleotide sequences in the event of the next outbreak.
    * In the United States, this machine would be designed to the standards of a Level 3 biosafety cabinet.

* the production of reagents is a bottleneck, which needs to be addressed separately
    * some reagents, such as the mRNA isolation kit, can be standardized
    * others, such as the primer used to attach to the specific genes of the virus, must be ready as soon as the genome is discovered
