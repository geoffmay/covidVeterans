* it might be feasible for all the bsl-4 to be robotic
* you might be able to do cleaning with a small amount (500uL) of solution.


* steps
    * lyse
    * isolate mRNA
        * liquid chromatography
    * create cDNA
    * amplify using PCR
        * parallel pipeline

* then you lyse the viral capsule

* elute RNA in e.g. 20 uL of solute
    * depends on polarity of molecule
    * contains ingredients for cDNA
        * reverse transcriptase
        * bases needed to construct cDNA
    * needs to be bare minmum volume of solute to maximize chances of molecules coming together.
        * this is called enrichment

* scientists used to have to synthesize things themselves. now companies take care of them and things are inconvenient.

* (build in the ability to )

* quality of sample collection is very, very important.
    * video supervision of collection?

* china had to develop genomic sequence.
* selection of primers is a judgement step chosen by experts.
    * for covid:
        * s protein that docks to the cell.
* synthesis of primers is not a big deal.
    * many companies are producing them.
    * the big deal is the cocktail.
        * it's proprietary what is in these. the whole game is around keeping the polymerase cocktail is secret.
        * they came out of academia and now they're working at Roche.
        * what do they add:
            * control pcr inhibitors (game changer)
        * polymerase



* RNA isolation kits are a challenge.
* cDNA kits are a challenge.


* targets for covid:
    * protease inhibitors for covid:
    * 

* enrichment happens before PCR: 
    * elute: 2mL -> 200mL

* then you plug into the fully automated part.
* we only need -20 degrees C, maybe even -10 degrees C.
    * if they're used within 2 weeks, they can be stored at room temperature.
* the RNA needs to be stored at -80 degrees C.
    * but if you 

* cooling centrifuges
* realtime pcr machine
* regular pcr machine


* silica gel columns for liquid chromatography
    * performed in an applied vaccuum.





* pipettes, etc
